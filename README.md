I am an incoming graduate student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) with a focus on data-intensive systems. 

Currently, I am actively seeking **2024 summer internship** opportunities in both the United States and China. Please feel free to contact me if there are any available opportunities, or if you are interested in my previous work.
